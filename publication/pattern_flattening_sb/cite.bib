abstract = {Abstract The acquisition of highly detailed static 3D scan data for people in clothing is becoming widely available. Since 3D scan data is given as a single mesh without semantic separation, in order to animate the data, it is necessary to model shape and deformation behaviour of individual body and garment parts. This paper presents a new method for generating simulation-ready garment models from 3D static scan data of clothed humans. A key contribution of our method is a novel approach to segmenting garments by finding optimal boundaries between the skin and garment. Our boundary-based garment segmentation method allows for stable and smooth separation of garments by using an implicit representation of the boundary and its optimization strategy. In addition, we present a novel framework to construct a 2D pattern from the segmented garment and place it around the body for a draping simulation. The effectiveness of our method is validated by generating garment patterns for a number of scan data.},
